# Stanford-Dogs-Classification
This Repo includes code (written in python ) for Stanford dogs data set classification . I have used PyTorch library for this purpose.
Top-1 Accuracy i have achieved is 76.66 % on Test set.
Top-5 Accuracy is 96.15% on Test set.  
This project is done using Resnet18. I also have used Transfer learning i.e. I have used a pre-trained model of Resnet18 from torchvision models.
I have used GPU for training provided freely by Google Colab.(Thanks to Google on such a great help for researchers).
