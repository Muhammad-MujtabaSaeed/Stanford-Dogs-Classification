# Stanford-Dogs-Classification
This Repo includes code (written in python ) for Stanford dogs data set classification . I have used PyTorch library for this purpose.
I have achieved approx 76% accuracy on test data set using Resnet18. I also have used Transfer learning i.e. I have used a pre-trained model of Resnet18 from torchvision models.
I have used GPU for training provided freely by Google Colab.(Thanks to Google on such a great help for researchers).
